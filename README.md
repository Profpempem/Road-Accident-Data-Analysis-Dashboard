# Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a comprehensive dataset of road traffic accidents in the UK, providing insights into factors contributing to accidents, such as weather, lighting, time of day, and road type. An interactive dashboard was built to visualize these insights and guide actionable safety recommendations.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Analyze the distribution and severity of accidents
- Identify trends by month, day, and time
- Examine environmental factors such as weather and light conditions
- Assess accident frequency by road type and location

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Most accidents occurred in urban areas under fine weather conditions.
- Peak accident times are during weekday rush hours (8–10 AM, 4–6 PM).
- Single carriageways and T-junctions are high-risk zones.
- Serious accidents are more common in poor weather or low-light conditions.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Enhance lighting and signage at high-risk junctions.
- Increase public awareness on driving during peak hours and poor weather.
- Use real-time data to guide traffic and emergency response improvements.
